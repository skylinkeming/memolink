        You don't know JS, yet. Neither do I, not fully anyway. None of us do.
        But we can all start getting to know JS better.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        In this first chapter of the first book of the
        <em>You Don't Know JS Yet</em> (YDKJSY) series, we will take some time
        to build a foundation to move forward on. We need to start by covering a
        variety of important background housekeeping details, clearing up some
        myths and misconceptions about what the language really is (and isn't!).
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        This is valuable insight into the identity and process of how JS is
        organized and maintained; all JS developers should understand it. If you
        want to get to know JS, this is how to <em>get started</em> taking the
        first steps in that journey.

        I emphasize the word journey because <em>knowing JS</em> is not a
        destination, it's a direction. No matter how much time you spend with
        the language, you will always be able to find something else to learn
        and understand a little better. So don't look at this book as something
        to rush through for a quick achievement. Instead, patience and
        persistence are best as you take these first few steps.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Following this background chapter, the rest of the book lays out a
        high-level map of what you will find as you dig into and study JS with
        the YDKJSY books.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        In particular, Chapter 4 identifies three main pillars around which the
        JS language is organized: scope/closures, prototypes/objects, and
        types/coercion. JS is a broad and sophisticated language, with many
        features and capabilities. But all of JS is founded on these three
        foundational pillars.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Keep in mind that even though this book is titled "Get Started," it's
        <strong>not intended as a beginner/intro book</strong>. This book's main
        job is to get you ready for studying JS deeply throughout the rest of
        the series; it's written assuming you already have familiarity with JS
        over at least several months experience before moving on in YDKJSY. So
        to get the most out of <em>Get Started</em>, make sure you spend plenty
        of time writing JS code to build up your experience.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Even if you've already written a lot of JS before, this book should not
        be skimmed over or skipped; take your time to fully process the material
        here.
        <strong>A good start always depends on a solid first step.</strong>

        The name JavaScript is probably the most mistaken and misunderstood
        programming language name.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Is this language related to Java? Is it only the script form for Java?
        Is it only for writing scripts and not real programs?
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        The truth is, the name JavaScript is an artifact of marketing
        shenanigans. When Brendan Eich first conceived of the language, he
        code-named it Mocha. Internally at Netscape, the brand LiveScript was
        used. But when it came time to publicly name the language, "JavaScript"
        won the vote.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Why? Because this language was originally designed to appeal to an
        audience of mostly Java programmers, and because the word "script" was
        popular at the time to refer to lightweight programs. These lightweight
        "scripts" would be the first ones to embed inside of pages on this new
        thing called the web!
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        In other words, JavaScript was a marketing ploy to try to position this
        language as a palatable alternative to writing the heavier and more
        well-known Java of the day. It could just as easily have been called
        "WebJava," for that matter.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        There are some superficial resemblances between JavaScript's code and
        Java code. Those similarities don't particularly come from shared
        development, but from both languages targeting developers with assumed
        syntax expectations from C (and to an extent, C++).
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        For example, we use the <code>{</code> to begin a block of code and the
        <code>}</code> to end that block of code, just like C/C++ and Java. We
        also use the <code>;</code> to punctuate the end of a statement.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        In some ways, legal relationships run even deeper than the syntax.
        Oracle (via Sun), the company that still owns and runs Java, also owns
        the official trademark for the name "JavaScript" (via Netscape). This
        trademark is almost never enforced, and likely couldn't be at this
        point.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        For these reasons, some have suggested we use JS instead of JavaScript.
        That is a very common shorthand, if not a good candidate for an official
        language branding itself. Indeed, these books use JS almost exclusively
        to refer to the language.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Further distancing the language from the Oracle-owned trademark, the
        official name of the language specified by TC39 and formalized by the
        ECMA standards body is <strong>ECMAScript</strong>. And indeed, since
        2016, the official language name has also been suffixed by the revision
        year; as of this writing, that's ECMAScript 2019, or otherwise
        abbreviated ES2019.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        In other words, the JavaScript/JS that runs in your browser or in
        Node.js, is <em>an</em> implementation of the ES2019 standard.

        I mentioned TC39, the technical steering committee that manages JS.
        Their primary task is managing the official specification for the
        language. They meet regularly to vote on any agreed changes, which they
        then submit to ECMA, the standards organization.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        JS's syntax and behavior are defined in the ES specification.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        ES2019 happens to be the 10th major numbered specification/revision
        since JS's inception in 1995, so in the specification's official URL as
        hosted by ECMA, you'll find "10.0":
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        <a

        >
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        The TC39 committee is comprised of between 50 and about 100 different
        people from a broad section of web-invested companies, such as browser
        makers (Mozilla, Google, Apple) and device makers (Samsung, etc). All
        members of the committee are volunteers, though many of them are
        employees of these companies and so may receive compensation in part for
        their duties on the committee.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        TC39 meets generally about every other month, usually for about three
        days, to review work done by members since the last meeting, discuss
        issues, and vote on proposals. Meeting locations rotate among member
        companies willing to host.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        All TC39 proposals progress through a five-stage process—of course,
        since we're programmers, it's 0-based!—Stage 0 through Stage 4. You can
        read more about the Stage process here:

        Stage 0 means roughly, someone on TC39 thinks it's a worthy idea and
        plans to champion and work on it. That means lots of ideas that non-TC39
        members "propose," through informal means such as social media or blog
        posts, are really "pre-stage 0." You have to get a TC39 member to
        champion a proposal for it to be considered "Stage 0" officially.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Once a proposal reaches "Stage 4" status, it is eligible to be included
        in the next yearly revision of the language. It can take anywhere from
        several months to a few years for a proposal to work its way through
        these stages.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        All proposals are managed in the open, on TC39's Github repository:
        <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals"
          >https://github.com/tc39/proposals</a
        >
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Anyone, whether on TC39 or not, is welcome to participate in these
        public discussions and the processes for working on the proposals.
        However, only TC39 members can attend meetings and vote on the proposals
        and changes. So in effect, the voice of a TC39 member carries a lot of
        weight in where JS will go.

        Contrary to some established and frustratingly perpetuated myth, there
        are <em>not</em> multiple versions of JavaScript in the wild. There's
        just <strong>one JS</strong>, the official standard as maintained by
        TC39 and ECMA.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Back in the early 2000s, when Microsoft maintained a forked and
        reverse-engineered (and not entirely compatible) version of JS called
        "JScript," there were legitimately "multiple versions" of JS. But those
        days are long gone. It's outdated and inaccurate to make such claims
        about JS today.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        All major browsers and device makers have committed to keeping their JS
        implementations compliant with this one central specification. Of
        course, engines implement features at different times. But it should
        never be the case that the v8 engine (Chrome's JS engine) implements a
        specified feature differently or incompatibly as compared to the
        SpiderMonkey engine (Mozilla's JS engine).
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        That means you can learn <strong>one JS</strong>, and rely on that same
        JS everywhere.

        While the array of environments that run JS is constantly expanding
        (from browsers, to servers (Node.js), to robots, to lightbulbs, to...),
        the one environment that rules JS is the web. In other words, how JS is
        implemented for web browsers is, in all practicality, the only reality
        that matters.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        For the most part, the JS defined in the specification and the JS that
        runs in browser-based JS engines is the same. But there are some
        differences that must be considered.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Sometimes the JS specification will dictate some new or refined
        behavior, and yet that won't exactly match with how it works in
        browser-based JS engines. Such a mismatch is historical: JS engines have
        had 20+ years of observable behaviors around corner cases of features
        that have come to be relied on by web content. As such, sometimes the JS
        engines will refuse to conform to a specification-dictated change
        because it would break that web content.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        In these cases, often TC39 will backtrack and simply choose to conform
        the specification to the reality of the web. For example, TC39 planned
        to add a <code>contains(..)</code> method for Arrays, but it was found
        that this name conflicted with old JS frameworks still in use on some
        sites, so they changed the name to a non-conflicting
        <code>includes(..)</code>. The same happened with a comedic/tragic JS
        <em>community crisis</em> dubbed "smooshgate," where the planned
        <code>flatten(..)</code> method was eventually renamed
        <code>flat(..)</code>.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        But occasionally, TC39 will decide the specification should stick firm
        on some point even though it is unlikely that browser-based JS engines
        will ever conform.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        The solution? Appendix B, "Additional ECMAScript Features for Web
        Browsers".<sup

        The JS specification includes this appendix to detail out any known
        mismatches between the official JS specification and the reality of JS
        on the web. In other words, these are exceptions that are allowed
        <em>only</em> for web JS; other JS environments must stick to the letter
        of the law.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Section B.1 and B.2 cover <em>additions</em> to JS (syntax and APIs)
        that web JS includes, again for historical reasons, but which TC39 does
        not plan to formally specify in the core of JS. Examples include
        <code>0</code>-prefixed octal literals, the global
        <code>escape(..)</code> / <code>unescape(..)</code> utilities, String
        "helpers" like <code>anchor(..)</code> and <code>blink()</code>, and the
        RegExp <code>compile(..)</code> method.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Section B.3 includes some conflicts where code may run in both web and
        non-web JS engines, but where the behavior <em>could</em> be observably
        different, resulting in different outcomes. Most of the listed changes
        involve situations that are labeled as early errors when code is running
        in strict mode.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Appendix B <em>gotchas</em> aren't encountered very often, but it's
        still a good idea to avoid these constructs to be future safe. Wherever
        possible, adhere to the JS specification and don't rely on behavior
        that's only applicable in certain JS engine environments.

        Depends on how you look at things. The <code>alert(..)</code> function
        shown here is not included in the JS specification, but it
        <em>is</em> in all web JS environments. Yet, you won't find it in
        Appendix B, so what gives?
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Various JS environments (like browser JS engines, Node.js, etc.) add
        APIs into the global scope of your JS programs that give you
        environment-specific capabilities, like being able to pop an alert-style
        box in the user's browser.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        In fact, a wide range of JS-looking APIs, like <code>fetch(..)</code>,
        <code>getCurrentLocation(..)</code>, and <code>getUserMedia(..)</code>,
        are all web APIs that look like JS. In Node.js, we can access hundreds
        of API methods from various built-in modules, like
        <code>fs.write(..)</code>.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Another common example is <code>console.log(..)</code> (and all the
        other <code>console.*</code> methods!). These are not specified in JS,
        but because of their universal utility are defined by pretty much every
        JS environment, according to a roughly agreed consensus.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        So <code>alert(..)</code> and <code>console.log(..)</code> are not
        defined by JS. But they <em>look</em> like JS. They are functions and
        object methods and they obey JS syntax rules. The behaviors behind them
        are controlled by the environment running the JS engine, but on the
        surface they definitely have to abide by JS to be able to play in the JS
        playground.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Most of the cross-browser differences people complain about with "JS is
        so inconsistent!" claims are actually due to differences in how those
        environment behaviors work, not in how the JS itself works.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        So an <code>alert(..)</code> call <em>is</em> JS, but
        <code>alert</code> itself is really just a guest, not part of the
        official JS specification.

        Using the console/REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) in your browser's
        Developer Tools (or Node) feels like a pretty straightforward JS
        environment at first glance. But it's not, really.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Developer Tools are... tools for developers. Their primary purpose is to
        make life easier for developers. They prioritize DX (Developer
        Experience). It is <em>not</em> a goal of such tools to accurately and
        purely reflect all nuances of strict-spec JS behavior. As such, there's
        many quirks that may act as "gotchas" if you're treating the console as
        a <em>pure</em> JS environment.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        This convenience is a good thing, by the way! I'm glad Developer Tools
        make developers' lives easier! I'm glad we have nice UX charms like
        auto-complete of variables/properties, etc. I'm just pointing out that
        we can't and shouldn't expect such tools to <em>always</em> adhere
        strictly to the way JS programs are handled, because that's not the
        purpose of these tools.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Since such tools vary in behavior from browser to browser, and since
        they change (sometimes rather frequently), I'm not going to "hardcode"
        any of the specific details into this text, thereby ensuring this book
        text is outdated quickly.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        But I'll just hint at some examples of quirks that have been true at
        various points in different JS console environments, to reinforce my
        point about not assuming native JS behavior while using them:

        The developer console is not trying to pretend to be a JS compiler that
        handles your entered code exactly the same way the JS engine handles a

        lines of code and see the results immediately. These are entirely

        The term "paradigm" in programming language context refers to a broad
        (almost universal) mindset and approach to structuring code. Within a
        paradigm, there are myriad variations of style and form that distinguish
        programs, including countless different libraries and frameworks that
        leave their unique signature on any given code.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        But no matter what a program's individual style may be, the big picture
        divisions around paradigms are almost always evident at first glance of
        any program.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Typical paradigm-level code categories include procedural,
        object-oriented (OO/classes), and functional (FP):
      </p>
      <ul dir="auto">
        <li>
          <p dir="auto">
            Procedural style organizes code in a top-down, linear progression
            through a pre-determined set of operations, usually collected
            together in related units called procedures.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p dir="auto">
            OO style organizes code by collecting logic and data together into
            units called classes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p dir="auto">
            FP style organizes code into functions (pure computations as opposed
            to procedures), and the adaptations of those functions as values.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p dir="auto">
        Paradigms are neither right nor wrong. They're orientations that guide
        and mold how programmers approach problems and solutions, how they
        structure and maintain their code.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Some languages are heavily slanted toward one paradigm—C is procedural,
        Java/C++ are almost entirely class oriented, and Haskell is FP through
        and through.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        But many languages also support code patterns that can come from, and
        even mix and match from, different paradigms. So called "multi-paradigm
        languages" offer ultimate flexibility. In some cases, a single program
        can even have two or more expressions of these paradigms sitting side by
        side.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        JavaScript is most definitely a multi-paradigm language. You can write
        procedural, class-oriented, or FP-style code, and you can make those
        decisions on a line-by-line basis instead of being forced into an
        all-or-nothing choice.

        One of the most foundational principles that guides JavaScript is
        preservation of <em>backwards compatibility</em>. Many are confused by
        the implications of this term, and often confuse it with a related but
        different term: <em>forwards compatibility</em>.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">Let's set the record straight.</p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Backwards compatibility means that once something is accepted as valid
        JS, there will not be a future change to the language that causes that
        code to become invalid JS. Code written in 1995—however primitive or
        limited it may have been!—should still work today. As TC39 members often
        proclaim, "we don't break the web!"
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        The idea is that JS developers can write code with confidence that their
        code won't stop working unpredictably because a browser update is
        released. This makes the decision to choose JS for a program a more wise
        and safe investment, for years into the future.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        That "guarantee" is no small thing. Maintaining backwards compatibility,
        stretched out across almost 25 years of the language's history, creates
        an enormous burden and a whole slew of unique challenges. You'd be hard
        pressed to find many other examples in computing of such a commitment to
        backwards compatibility.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        The costs of sticking to this principle should not be casually
        dismissed. It necessarily creates a very high bar to including changing
        or extending the language; any decision becomes effectively permanent,
        mistakes and all. Once it's in JS, it can't be taken out because it
        might break programs, even if we'd really, really like to remove it!
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        There are some small exceptions to this rule. JS has had some
        backwards-incompatible changes, but TC39 is extremely cautious in doing
        so. They study existing code on the web (via browser data gathering) to
        estimate the impact of such breakage, and browsers ultimately decide and
        vote on whether they're willing to take the heat from users for a very
        small-scale breakage weighed against the benefits of fixing or improving
        some aspect of the language for many more sites (and users).
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        These kinds of changes are rare, and are almost always in corner cases
        of usage that are unlikely to be observably breaking in many sites.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Compare <em>backwards compatibility</em> to its counterpart,
        <em>forwards compatibility</em>. Being forwards-compatible means that
        including a new addition to the language in a program would not cause
        that program to break if it were run in an older JS engine.
        <strong>JS is not forwards-compatible</strong>, despite many wishing
        such, and even incorrectly believing the myth that it is.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        HTML and CSS, by contrast, are forwards-compatible but not
        backwards-compatible. If you dug up some HTML or CSS written back in
        1995, it's entirely possible it would not work (or work the same) today.
        But, if you use a new feature from 2019 in a browser from 2010, the page
        isn't "broken" -- the unrecognized CSS/HTML is skipped over, while the
        rest of the CSS/HTML would be processed accordingly.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        It may seem desirable for forwards-compatibility to be included in
        programming language design, but it's generally impractical to do so.
        Markup (HTML) or styling (CSS) are declarative in nature, so it's much
        easier to "skip over" unrecognized declarations with minimal impact to
        other recognized declarations.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        But chaos and non-determinism would ensue if a programming language
        engine selectively skipped statements (or even expressions!) that it
        didn't understand, as it's impossible to ensure that a subsequent part
        of the program wasn't expecting the skipped-over part to have been
        processed.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Though JS isn't, and can't be, forwards-compatible, it's critical to
        recognize JS's backwards compatibility, including the enduring benefits
        to the web and the constraints and difficulties it places on JS as a
        result.

        Since JS is not forwards-compatible, it means that there is always the
        potential for a gap between code that you can write that's valid JS, and
        the oldest engine that your site or application needs to support. If you
        run a program that uses an ES2019 feature in an engine from 2016, you're
        very likely to see the program break and crash.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        If the feature is a new syntax, the program will in general completely
        fail to compile and run, usually throwing a syntax error. If the feature
        is an API (such as ES6's <code>Object.is(..)</code>), the program may
        run up to a point but then throw a runtime exception and stop once it
        encounters the reference to the unknown API.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Does this mean JS developers should always lag behind the pace of
        progress, using only code that is on the trailing edge of the oldest JS
        engine environments they need to support? No!
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        But it does mean that JS developers need to take special care to address
        this gap.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        For new and incompatible syntax, the solution is transpiling.
        Transpiling is a contrived and community-invented term to describe using
        a tool to convert the source code of a program from one form to another
        (but still as textual source code). Typically, forwards-compatibility
        problems related to syntax are solved by using a transpiler (the most
        common one being Babel (<a href="https://babeljs.io" rel="nofollow"
          >https://babeljs.io</a
        >)) to convert from that newer JS syntax version to an equivalent older
        syntax.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        For example, a developer may write a snippet of code like:

        The original snippet relied on <code>let</code> to create block-scoped
        <code>x</code> variables in both the <code>if</code> and
        <code>else</code> clauses which did not interfere with each other. An
        equivalent program (with minimal re-working) that Babel can produce just
        chooses to name two different variables with unique names, producing the
        same non-interference outcome.

                The <code>let</code> keyword was added in ES6 (in 2015). The
                preceding example of transpiling would only need to apply if an
                application needed to run in a pre-ES6 supporting JS
                environment. The example here is just for simplicity of
                illustration. When ES6 was new, the need for such a
                transpilation was quite prevalent, but in 2020 it's much less
                common to need to support pre-ES6 environments. The "target"
                used for transpilation is thus a sliding window that shifts
                upward only as decisions are made for a site/application to stop
                supporting some old browser/engine.

        You may wonder: why go to the trouble of using a tool to convert from a
        newer syntax version to an older one? Couldn't we just write the two
        variables and skip using the <code>let</code> keyword? The reason is,
        it's strongly recommended that developers use the latest version of JS
        so that their code is clean and communicates its ideas most effectively.

        Developers should focus on writing the clean, new syntax forms, and let
        the tools take care of producing a forwards-compatible version of that
        code that is suitable to deploy and run on the oldest-supported JS
        engine environments.

        If the forwards-compatibility issue is not related to new syntax, but
        rather to a missing API method that was only recently added, the most
        common solution is to provide a definition for that missing API method
        that stands in and acts as if the older environment had already had it
        natively defined. This pattern is called a polyfill (aka "shim").

        The <code>if</code> statement protects the polyfill definition by
        preventing it from running in any environment where the JS engine has
        already defined that method. In older environments, the polyfill is
        defined, but in newer environments the <code>if</code> statement is
        quietly skipped.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Transpilers like Babel typically detect which polyfills your code needs
        and provide them automatically for you. But occasionally you may need to
        include/define them explicitly, which works similar to the snippet we

        Always write code using the most appropriate features to communicate its

        recent stable JS version. Avoid negatively impacting the code's
        readability by trying to manually adjust for the syntax/API gaps. That's
        what tools are for!
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Transpilation and polyfilling are two highly effective techniques for
        addressing that gap between code that uses the latest stable features in
        the language and the old environments a site or application needs to
        still support. Since JS isn't going to stop improving, the gap will
        never go away. Both techniques should be embraced as a standard part of
        every JS project's production chain going forward.

      <p dir="auto">
        A long-debated question for code written in JS: is it an interpreted
        script or a compiled program? The majority opinion seems to be that JS
        is an interpreted (scripting) language. But the truth is more
        complicated than that.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        For much of the history of programming languages, "interpreted"
        languages and "scripting" languages have been looked down on as inferior
        compared to their compiled counterparts. The reasons for this acrimony
        are numerous, including the perception that there is a lack of
        performance optimization, as well as dislike of certain language
        characteristics, such as scripting languages generally using dynamic
        typing instead of the "more mature" statically typed languages.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Languages regarded as "compiled" usually produce a portable (binary)
        representation of the program that is distributed for execution later.
        Since we don't really observe that kind of model with JS (we distribute
        the source code, not the binary form), many claim that disqualifies JS
        from the category. In reality, the distribution model for a program's
        "executable" form has become drastically more varied and also less
        relevant over the last few decades; to the question at hand, it doesn't
        really matter so much anymore what form of a program gets passed around.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        These misinformed claims and criticisms should be set aside. The real
        reason it matters to have a clear picture on whether JS is interpreted
        or compiled relates to the nature of how errors are handled.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Historically, scripted or interpreted languages were executed in
        generally a top-down and line-by-line fashion; there's typically not an
        initial pass through the program to process it before execution begins
        (see Figure 1).
      </p>

      <p dir="auto">
        In scripted or interpreted languages, an error on line 5 of a program
        won't be discovered until lines 1 through 4 have already executed.
        Notably, the error on line 5 might be due to a runtime condition, such
        as some variable or value having an unsuitable value for an operation,
        or it may be due to a malformed statement/command on that line.
        Depending on context, deferring error handling to the line the error
        occurs on may be a desirable or undesirable effect.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Compare that to languages which do go through a processing step
        (typically, called parsing) before any execution occurs, as illustrated
        in Figure 2:
      </p>

      <em>Fig. 2: Parsing + Compilation + Execution</em>
      <br /><br />

      <p dir="auto">
        In this processing model, an invalid command (such as broken syntax) on
        line 5 would be caught during the parsing phase, before any execution
        has begun, and none of the program would run. For catching syntax (or
        otherwise "static") errors, generally it's preferred to know about them
        ahead of any doomed partial execution.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        So what do "parsed" languages have in common with "compiled" languages?
        First, all compiled languages are parsed. So a parsed language is quite
        a ways down the road toward being compiled already. In classic
        compilation theory, the last remaining step after parsing is code
        generation: producing an executable form.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Once any source program has been fully parsed, it's very common that its
        subsequent execution will, in some form or fashion, include a
        translation from the parsed form of the program—usually called an
        Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)—to that executable form.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        In other words, parsed languages usually also perform code generation
        before execution, so it's not that much of a stretch to say that, in
        spirit, they're compiled languages.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        JS source code is parsed before it is executed. The specification
        requires as much, because it calls for "early errors"—statically
        determined errors in code, such as a duplicate parameter name—to be
        reported before the code starts executing. Those errors cannot be
        recognized without the code having been parsed.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        So <strong>JS is a parsed language</strong>, but is it
        <em>compiled</em>?
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        The answer is closer to yes than no. The parsed JS is converted to an
        optimized (binary) form, and that "code" is subsequently executed
        (Figure 2); the engine does not commonly switch back into line-by-line
        execution (like Figure 1) mode after it has finished all the hard work
        of parsing—most languages/engines wouldn't, because that would be highly
        inefficient.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        To be specific, this "compilation" produces a binary byte code (of
        sorts), which is then handed to the "JS virtual machine" to execute.
        Some like to say this VM is "interpreting" the byte code. But then that
        means Java, and a dozen other JVM-driven languages, for that matter, are
        interpreted rather than compiled. Of course, that contradicts the
        typical assertion that Java/etc are compiled languages.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Interestingly, while Java and JavaScript are very different languages,
        the question of interpreted/compiled is pretty closely related between
        them!
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Another wrinkle is that JS engines can employ multiple passes of JIT
        (Just-In-Time) processing/optimization on the generated code (post
        parsing), which again could reasonably be labeled either "compilation"
        or "interpretation" depending on perspective. It's actually a
        fantastically complex situation under the hood of a JS engine.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        So what do these nitty-gritty details boil down to? Step back and
        consider the entire flow of a JS source program:
      </p>
      <ol dir="auto">
        <li>
          <p dir="auto">
            After a program leaves a developer's editor, it gets transpiled by
            Babel, then packed by Webpack (and perhaps half a dozen other build
            processes), then it gets delivered in that very different form to a
            JS engine.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p dir="auto">The JS engine parses the code to an AST.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p dir="auto">
            Then the engine converts that AST to a kind-of byte code, a binary
            intermediate representation (IR), which is then refined/converted
            even further by the optimizing JIT compiler.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p dir="auto">Finally, the JS VM executes the program.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p dir="auto">To visualize those steps, again:</p>
      <em>Fig. 3: Parsing, Compiling, and Executing JS</em>
      <br /><br />

      <p dir="auto">
        Is JS handled more like an interpreted, line-by-line script, as in
        Figure 1, or is it handled more like a compiled language that's
        processed in one-to-several passes first, before execution (as in
        Figures 2 and 3)?
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        I think it's clear that in spirit, if not in practice,
        <strong>JS is a compiled language</strong>.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        And again, the reason that matters is, since JS is compiled, we are
        informed of static errors (such as malformed syntax) before our code is
        executed. That is a substantively different interaction model than we
        get with traditional "scripting" programs, and arguably more helpful!

        One dominating concern that has driven a significant amount of JS's

        how quickly that compiled code can be executed.

      <p dir="auto">
        In 2013, engineers from Mozilla Firefox demonstrated a port of the
        Unreal 3 game engine from C to JS. The ability for this code to run in a
        browser JS engine at full 60fps performance was predicated on a set of
        optimizations that the JS engine could perform specifically because the
        JS version of the Unreal engine's code used a style of code that favored
        a subset of the JS language, named "ASM.js".

      <p dir="auto">
        This subset is valid JS written in ways that are somewhat uncommon in
        normal coding, but which signal certain important typing information to
        the engine that allow it to make key optimizations. ASM.js was
        introduced as one way of addressing the pressures on the runtime
        performance of JS.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        But it's important to note that ASM.js was never intended to be code
        that was authored by developers, but rather a representation of a
        program having been transpiled from another language (such as C), where
        these typing "annotations" were inserted automatically by the tooling.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Several years after ASM.js demonstrated the validity of tooling-created
        versions of programs that can be processed more efficiently by the JS
        engine, another group of engineers (also, initially, from Mozilla)
        released Web Assembly (WASM).
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        WASM is similar to ASM.js in that its original intent was to provide a
        path for non-JS programs (C, etc.) to be converted to a form that could
        run in the JS engine. Unlike ASM.js, WASM chose to additionally get
        around some of the inherent delays in JS parsing/compilation before a
        program can execute, by representing the program in a form that is
        entirely unlike JS.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        WASM is a representation format more akin to Assembly (hence, its name)
        that can be processed by a JS engine by skipping the parsing/compilation
        that the JS engine normally does. The parsing/compilation of a
        WASM-targeted program happen ahead of time (AOT); what's distributed is
        a binary-packed program ready for the JS engine to execute with very
        minimal processing.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        An initial motivation for WASM was clearly the potential performance
        improvements. While that continues to be a focus, WASM is additionally
        motivated by the desire to bring more parity for non-JS languages to the
        web platform. For example, if a language like Go supports threaded
        programming, but JS (the language) does not, WASM offers the potential
        for such a Go program to be converted to a form the JS engine can
        understand, without needing a threads feature in the JS language itself.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        In other words, WASM relieves the pressure to add features to JS that
        are mostly/exclusively intended to be used by transpiled programs from
        other languages. That means JS feature development can be judged (by
        TC39) without being skewed by interests/demands in other language
        ecosystems, while still letting those languages have a viable path onto
        the web.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Another perspective on WASM that's emerging is, interestingly, not even
        directly related to the web (W). WASM is evolving to become a
        cross-platform virtual machine (VM) of sorts, where programs can be
        compiled once and run in a variety of different system environments.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        So, WASM isn't only for the web, and WASM also isn't JS. Ironically,
        even though WASM runs in the JS engine, the JS language is one of the
        least suitable languages to source WASM programs with, because WASM
        relies heavily on static typing information. Even TypeScript
        (TS)—ostensibly, JS + static types—is not quite suitable (as it stands)
        to transpile to WASM, though language variants like AssemblyScript are
        attempting to bridge the gap between JS/TS and WASM.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        This book isn't about WASM, so I won't spend much more time discussing
        it, except to make one final point. <em>Some</em> folks have suggested
        WASM points to a future where JS is excised from, or minimized in, the
        web. These folks often harbor ill feelings about JS, and want some other
        language—any other language!—to replace it. Since WASM lets other
        languages run in the JS engine, on its face this isn't an entirely
        fanciful fairytale.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        But let me just state simply: WASM will not replace JS. WASM
        significantly augments what the web (including JS) can accomplish.
        That's a great thing, entirely orthogonal to whether some people will
        use it as an escape hatch from having to write JS.

        Back in 2009 with the release of ES5, JS added <em>strict mode</em> as
        an opt-in mechanism for encouraging better JS programs.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        The benefits of strict mode far outweigh the costs, but old habits die
        hard and the inertia of existing (aka "legacy") code bases is really
        hard to shift. So sadly, more than 10 years later, strict mode's
        <em>optionality</em> means that it's still not necessarily the default
        for JS programmers.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Why strict mode? Strict mode shouldn't be thought of as a restriction on
        what you can't do, but rather as a guide to the best way to do things so
        that the JS engine has the best chance of optimizing and efficiently
        running the code. Most JS code is worked on by teams of developers, so
        the <em>strict</em>-ness of strict mode (along with tooling like
        linters!) often helps collaboration on code by avoiding some of the more
        problematic mistakes that slip by in non-strict mode.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Most strict mode controls are in the form of <em>early errors</em>,
        meaning errors that aren't strictly syntax errors but are still thrown
        at compile time (before the code is run). For example, strict mode
        disallows naming two function parameters the same, and results in an
        early error. Some other strict mode controls are only observable at
        runtime, such as how <code>this</code> defaults to
        <code>undefined</code> instead of the global object.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Rather than fighting and arguing with strict mode, like a kid who just
        wants to defy whatever their parents tell them not to do, the best
        mindset is that strict mode is like a linter reminding you how JS
        <em>should</em> be written to have the highest quality and best chance
        at performance. If you find yourself feeling handcuffed, trying to work
        around strict mode, that should be a blaring red warning flag that you
        need to back up and rethink the whole approach.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Strict mode is switched on per file with a special pragma (nothing

        Interestingly, if a file has strict mode turned on, the function-level
        strict mode pragmas are disallowed. So you have to pick one or the
        other.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        The <strong>only</strong> valid reason to use a per-function approach to
        strict mode is when you are converting an existing non-strict mode
        program file and need to make the changes little by little over time.
        Otherwise, it's vastly better to simply turn strict mode on for the
        entire file/program.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Many have wondered if there would ever be a time when JS made strict
        mode the default? The answer is, almost certainly not. As we discussed
        earlier around backwards compatibility, if a JS engine update started
        assuming code was strict mode even if it's not marked as such, it's
        possible that this code would break as a result of strict mode's
        controls.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        However, there are a few factors that reduce the future impact of this
        non-default "obscurity" of strict mode.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        For one, virtually all transpiled code ends up in strict mode even if
        the original source code isn't written as such. Most JS code in
        production has been transpiled, so that means most JS is already
        adhering to strict mode. It's possible to undo that assumption, but you
        really have to go out of your way to do so, so it's highly unlikely.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Moreover, a wide shift is happening toward more/most new JS code being
        written using the ES6 module format. ES6 modules assume strict mode, so
        all code in such files is automatically defaulted to strict mode.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Taken together, strict mode is largely the de facto default even though
        technically it's not actually the default.

        JS is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard (version ES2019 as of
        this writing), which is guided by the TC39 committee and hosted by ECMA.
        It runs in browsers and other JS environments such as Node.js.

      <p dir="auto">
        JS is a multi-paradigm language, meaning the syntax and capabilities
        allow a developer to mix and match (and bend and reshape!) concepts from
        various major paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented
        (OO/classes), and functional (FP).
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        JS is a compiled language, meaning the tools (including the JS engine)
        process and verify a program (reporting any errors!) before it executes.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        With our language now <em>defined</em>, let's start getting to know its
        ins and outs.
